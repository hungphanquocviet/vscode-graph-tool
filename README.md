# VS Code Graph Tool

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to create and visualize graph data structures directly within your code editor. It provides a simple interface to create nodes and edges, and then translates the graph into a text file in the DOT language, which is commonly used for graph descriptions.

## Features

- Create nodes and edges using a visual interface.
- Allow undo/redo, erase certain parts of the visualization, delete the whole canvas
- Generate a text file in the DOT language based on the created graph.

## Installation
